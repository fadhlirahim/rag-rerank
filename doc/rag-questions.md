# RAG System Evaluation Questions: Sherlock Holmes

The following questions are designed to test the accuracy, comprehension, and synthesis capabilities of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" as the knowledge base.

## Test Questions

1. **Character Relationship Test**: "In the story 'A Scandal in Bohemia', what is the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler, and why is she significant to him?"
   - This tests the system's ability to extract character relationships and motivations.

2. **Deductive Reasoning Test**: "Describe Holmes' method of deduction when he deduces that Watson had been getting wet recently and had a careless servant girl. What specific observations led to these conclusions?"
   - This tests the system's ability to identify and explain complex reasoning processes.

3. **Plot Sequence Test**: "What sequence of events led to Holmes unexpectedly becoming a witness at a wedding in 'A Scandal in Bohemia'? Provide the complete chain of events in chronological order."
   - This tests the system's ability to reconstruct narrative sequences across multiple paragraphs.

4. **Setting Detail Test**: "Describe the physical appearance and security features of Irene Adler's residence at Briony Lodge as observed by Holmes during his investigation."
   - This tests the system's ability to consolidate specific descriptive details.

5. **Character Observation Test**: "What disguise did Holmes use to gather information about Irene Adler, and what specific details did he learn through this disguise?"
   - This tests the system's ability to track character actions and information gathering across multiple paragraphs.

## Evaluation Criteria

Each question evaluates different aspects of the RAG system:
- Information retrieval accuracy
- Context understanding
- Cross-paragraph reasoning
- Detail extraction fidelity
- Narrative comprehension

These questions should provide a comprehensive assessment of how well the RAG and reranking components work with literary narrative text that contains complex character relationships, detailed descriptions, and sequential events.

## Answers

### Question 1: Character Relationship Test
In the story 'A Scandal in Bohemia', Irene Adler is significant to Sherlock Holmes because she is the only woman who has ever outsmarted him. Holmes used to make light of the cleverness of women, but after his encounter with Irene Adler, he holds her in high regard and refers to her with the honourable title of "the woman." She is significant to him because her wit and intelligence managed to beat his best plans, leaving a lasting impression on him.
